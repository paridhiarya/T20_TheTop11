# T20: The Top 11

**T20: The Top 11** is a data science project aimed at creating a cricket team consisting of the top 11 cricketers currently on the scene. The objective is to form a team that can consistently score at least 180 runs in a T20 match on average while also being able to defend 150 runs on average.

## Objective
