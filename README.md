# T20: The Top 11

**T20: The Top 11** is a data science project aimed at creating a cricket team consisting of the top 11 cricketers currently on the scene. The objective is to form a team that can consistently score at least 180 runs in a T20 match on average while also being able to defend 150 runs on average.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to use data science techniques and analysis to select the best combination of cricketers who, when playing together, can meet the following criteria:

- **Scoring Capability**: The team should have the ability to score at least 180 runs on average in a T20 match.

- **Defensive Strength**: The team should be able to defend 150 runs on average in a T20 match.

## Technologies Used

The project employs the following technologies:

- **Power BI**: Used for data visualization and analytics to gain insights into player performance and team composition.

- **Python**: Utilized for data analysis, modeling, and statistical calculations.

- **JavaScript (JS)**: Utilized for web scraping to get data related to the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Color and Weight Sensing Object Sorting Model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/color-weight-sensing-sorting-model.git

2. Set up the necessary hardware components, including Arduino Uno, Node-MCU, and HX711 Load Cell, and ensure they are properly connected.

3. Install the Android application on your mobile device and connect it to the system.

4. Start using the system to sort objects based on their color and weight.

## Usage
1. Launch the Android application and connect it to the hardware system.

2. Place objects on the sensing platform and initiate the sorting process using the Android interface.

3. The system will sort objects into four bins, and the Android interface will display object descriptions and counts in real time.

4. Customize and configure the system to meet your specific sorting requirements and object categories.
